<P>Java is a <b>secure language </b>bthat ensures that programs cannot gain access to memory locations without authorization. It has access modifiers to check memory access. Java also ensures that no viruses enter an applet. Java's bytecode verifier checks the code blocks for any illegal code that violates the access right

  <h2>JAVA CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
  <p>Java is an object-oriented programming language. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, rather than functions and logic. An object is a data field with its own set of properties and behavior. For example, a student class can have variables like Name, Class, Roll Number, Fatherâ€™s Name, Marks, and methods to store and retrieve these values. 

    Object-oriented programming (OOP) focuses on the objects that developers desire to handle, rather than the logic that is required to manipulate them. This kind of programming is ideally suited to big, complicated, and frequently updated or maintained projects. This encompasses manufacturing and design software, as well as mobile applications; for example, OOP may be used to simulate manufacturing systems. </p>
