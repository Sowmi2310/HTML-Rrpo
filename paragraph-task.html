    <h1>Features of JAVA</h1>
    <p>Java is a secure language that ensures that programs cannot gain access to memory locations without authorization. It has access modifiers to check memory access. Java also ensures that no viruses enter an applet. Java's bytecode verifier checks the code blocks for any illegal code that violates the access right</p>
